 # Data_Scraping_projects  Data scraping, also known as web scraping, is the process of importing information from a website into a spreadsheet or local file saved on your computer. It’s one of the most efficient ways to get data from the web, and in some cases to channel that data to another website. Popular uses of data scraping include:      Research for web content/business intelligence     Pricing for travel booker sites/price comparison sites     Finding sales leads/conducting market research by crawling public data sources (e.g. Yell and Twitter)     Sending product data from an e-commerce site to another online vendor (e.g. Google Shopping)  And that list’s just scratching the surface. Data scraping has a vast number of applications – it’s useful in just about any case where data needs to be moved from one place to another.  The basics of data scraping are relatively easy to master. Let’s go through how to set up a simple data scraping action using Excel.
